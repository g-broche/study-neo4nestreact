Things to take a look at in the future :

Possibility of defining a node value as being unique among all nodes of this label through constraints in the graph db itself or must this be handled in the backend.

How updating & deleting is usually done in graph in regards to identifier : must include id property to a node (or other uniquely defined value) or can use a graphe db nodeid ?
